Not all features are implemented such as the 'scale image on hover' and 'entire card clickable'. 
I have not created scollable components using javascript before, and hover and click is disabled 
somehow due to the way I have set up the scrollable feature I believe.

I did not use Tailwind CSS as I have never used it but it is something 
I would be interested in learning as I can see the benefits of it.
